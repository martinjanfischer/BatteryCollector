# Battery Collector

## Purpose
I have created this repository for learning the Unreal Engine and its C++ and Blueprint Visual Scripting API.

I do not consider this demo finished! 
It is just a sandbox for exploring the features of the Unreal Engine and I will add more functionality and assets to this demo in future.

## Contents
It contains an implementation of the 'Battery Collector' game as described in the Unreal Engine video tutorial series **C++ 3rd Person Battery Collector Power Up Game**
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gYup-gvJtMsgJqnEB_dGiM4/mSRov77hNR4/index.html).

I added assets from the **Content Examples** as described in 
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Resources/ContentExamples).

## Installation
Just clone this repository from 
https://github.com/martinjanfischer/BatteryCollector.git
open the Unreal project file and build it. 

## Requirements
The game was created in Unreal version 4.18.3 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community.

## Usage
To play the game, use WASD to move and C to collect batteries.
