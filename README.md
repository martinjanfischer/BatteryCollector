A finished implementation of the 'Battery Collector' game described in the Unreal Engine video tutorial series **C++ 3rd Person Battery Collector Power Up Game**
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gYup-gvJtMsgJqnEB_dGiM4/mSRov77hNR4/index.html).

I added assets from the **Content Examples** as described in 
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Resources/ContentExamples).

Just clone this repository and open the Unreal project file. 
The game was created in Unreal version 4.18.3.

To play the game, use WASD to move and C to collect batteries.
