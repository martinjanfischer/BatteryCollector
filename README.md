# Battery Collector

## Purpose
I created this repository for learning the **Unreal Engine** and its **C++** and **Blueprint** Visual Scripting **API**.

I do **not** consider this demo **finished**! 

It is just a sandbox for exploring the features of the Unreal Engine and I will add more functionality and assets to this demo in future.

In this feature branch I try to integrate the Zombie AI from the 'Tanks vs. Zombies' game into the 'BatteryCollector' game.
I will try to use the Mannequin Rig as Zombie.

## Contents
It contains an implementation of the 'Battery Collector' game as described in the Unreal Engine video tutorial series **C++ 3rd Person Battery Collector Power Up Game**
[here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gYup-gvJtMsgJqnEB_dGiM4/mSRov77hNR4/index.html)
and fragments of the implementation of the 'Tanks vs. Zombies' game as described in the Unreal Engine video tutorial series **C++ Tanks vs Zombies**
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyXq0Hy9xQs&list=PLZlv_N0_O1gaz3ydgU5wt6c_JtJzwXUKW&index=1).

I added assets from the **Content Examples** as described in
